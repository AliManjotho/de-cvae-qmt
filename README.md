# From Action to Reaction: Human Reaction Motion Synthesis using Latent Space Regularization and Alignment with Intermediate Motion Semantics

We propose a novel dual-encoder conditional variational auto encoder network (DE-CVAE). DE-CVAE comprises two encoders to learn the action and reaction motion spaces separately, with a decoder generating the reaction-motion sequence.
